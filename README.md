# Medicine Data Portal
This repository contains source code of a prototype version of an official project I have been working on. It is a data reporting tool for a large sized pharma companies which has multiple partner pharma companies. 
<br><br>
The prototype is hosted on my free tier azure instance at: http://mpp-prototype.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/
<br><br>
The Frontend of the website is based on ReactJS and Backend on Django REST Framework. In addition, Docker, Nginx, Gunicorn and Celery were used for load balancing, deployment and task scheduling.
